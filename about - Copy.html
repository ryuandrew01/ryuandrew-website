                    Calapan is the capital city of the Oriental Mindoro Province,located on the northeast side by the
                    Calapan Bay. It is the only cityin the province and is the center of commence, higher education, trade
                    activities and religion activities. First founded by Spanish Agustinian Recollect,Fr. Diego de la Madre
                    de Dios in 1679, Calapan started as a parish church with built settlements around it lateron becoming a
                    samll town. these settlements around it later on becoming a smalll town. These settlements were built near
                    the seashore along Calpan River. The development of the town of Calapan was thus similar to the pattern of
                    town development during the Spanish colonial era where the establishment of residences, towm hall and plaza
                    were built around the church under the watchful eyes of the Spanish priests. With the gradual development,
                    eventually became the seat of administration power and the capital of the whole province of Oriental Mindoro
                    during the last stages of the Spanish period.

                            &nbsp;&nbsp; Act No. 9485, otherwise known as the Anti-Red Tape Act of 2007, was enacted into law to improve efficiency
                            in the delivery of government services to the public by reducing bureaucratic red tape, preventing graft and
                            corruption.

                            The Anti-Red Tape Act of 2007 was signed into law amid corruption and bureaucratic red tape that are besetting
                            government agencies for the past decades.

                            Through this Act, all government offices including local government units and government-owned and -controlled
                            corporations are required to expedite transactions and/or adopt fixed deadline for the completion of
                            transactions and assess regularly as well as enhance their frontline services.

                            This Act also requires all agencies to maintain honesty and responsibility among its public officials and
                            employees, and shall take appropriate measures to promote transparency in each agency with regard to the
                            manner of transacting with the public.

                            RA 9485 also states that heads of government offices are accountable to the public in rendering fast,
                            efficient, convenient, and reliable services. It also requires agencies concerned to act on pending
                            papers within five working days involving simple transactions and a minimum of 10 days for complex cases.
                            Thus the PNP, in support to this Act, has adopted various modifications and revisited its frontline
                            services for the convenience of the transacting public minus the unnecessary voluminous documents.

                            With the City Goverment of Calapan(CGC) Citizen’s Charter, the public is now assured of more courteous, efficient, and prompt
                            frontline service providers willing to be of service 24/7.
