                 Calapan is the capital city of the Oriental Mindoro Province,located on the northeast side by the
            Calapan Bay. It is the only cityin the province and is the center of commence, higher education, trade
            activities and religion activities. First founded by Spanish Agustinian Recollect,Fr. Diego de la Madre
            de Dios in 1679, Calapan started as a parish church with built settlements around it lateron becoming a
            samll town. these settlements around it later on becoming a smalll town. These settlements were built near
            the seashore along Calpan River. The development of the town of Calapan was thus similar to the pattern of
            town development during the Spanish colonial era where the establishment of residences, towm hall and plaza 
            were built around the church under the watchful eyes of the Spanish priests. With the gradual development,
            eventually became the seat of administration power and the capital of the whole province of Oriental Mindoro 
            during the last stages of the Spanish period.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calapan was formely a small village before the stablishment of the<br />
            first Religion District in Baco.The District convent was trasferred to<br />
            Calapan in 1733 and began jurisdiction over the Northern Mindodro<br />
            Ecclesiatical Area.<br /> <br />

            In the early 18th century, the town occupied only a strip of land<br />
            stretching from Ibaba to Ilaya in a cross-formed facing the present church<br />
            and cut off by the river.In the course of the century, succeeding barrios<br />
            were founded.<br /> <br />

            In 1837, the capital of province was moved from Puerto Gallera to<br />
            Calapan. When Mindoro became a part of Marinduque on June 13,1902,<br />
            under Act. No. 423, the capital of Mindoro was transfered back to Puerto Gallera<br />
            under the Law. It was re-transfered to Calapan in 1903 for geographical<br />
            and transportational purposes.<br /><br />

            When Mindoro was detached from Marinduque on November 10,<br />
            1902, Baco, Puerto Galera and San Teodoro were annexed to Calapan in <br />
            1905 under Act.1280, addimg a total area of 843 sq. km. of land. In 1902<br>
            under Act 2824, the three(3) manicipalities gained their independence.<br /> <br />

            In 1919, the boundary dispute between Calapan and Naujan was<br />
            adjudicated by President Agustin Quijano of Calapan and Agustin Garong<br />
            of Naujan over a portion of the territory of whats is now known as the <br />
            present boundary. The portion of agrecultural area was awarded to<br />
            Naujan, thus, making the area of Calapan much smaller as compared to<br />
            that of Naujan which is now considered as the biggest municipality of the<br />
            province.<br /> <br />

            At present Calapan has an area of only 250.06 sq. km. (according to<br />
            LMB). It has jurisdiction over the three(3) Baco Islets on the Calapan<br />
            Bay and the two(2) Silonay Islets.<br /><br />

            The City of Calapan has been transformed as a component city on<br />
            March 21, 1998. Its conversion was based on Republic Act 8475, enacted<br />
            by Congress and signed into law by President Fidel V. Ramos on February<br />
            2, 1998. In a plebiscite held om March 21, 1998, majority of Calapeños<br />
            ratified the conversion of Calapan into a city. It is the first and only city in<br />
            the province of Oriental Mindoro.
